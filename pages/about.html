          <h2>Professional Background</h2>
          <p>
            Amber is a public library branch manager whose work centers on building
            welcoming, inclusive spaces where community members can explore ideas,
            access resources, and imagine new futures for themselves and their neighborhoods.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an MLIS graduate student, she studies the affective and social dimensions of
            information seeking, with particular attention to how Black communities navigate
            systems that were not designed with them in mind.

          <h2>Research & Practice</h2>
          <p>

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Black information futures and speculative approaches to librarianship</li>
            <li>Information behavior in marginalized and under-resourced communities</li>
            <li>AI and machine learning in public library contexts</li>
            <li>Ethical and community-informed uses of emerging technologies</li>

            Her practice as a branch manager informs her research questions, and her research
            in turn shapes the programs and partnerships she develops.
